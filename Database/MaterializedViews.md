## üîç **1. What Are Views?**
**Definition:** A **virtual table** created by a SQL query. It **does not store data** but acts as a saved query.

### **Example**
```sql
CREATE VIEW active_users AS
SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE is_active = true;
```
üìå **Key Points:**  
‚úî **No storage** (data is fetched live from underlying tables).  
‚úî **Simplifies complex queries** (e.g., joins, aggregations).  
‚úî **Security** (restrict access to specific columns).

---

## üì¶ **2. What Are Materialized Views?**
**Definition:** A **physical snapshot** of a query result stored on disk. Unlike views, **data is precomputed and persisted**.

### **Example (PostgreSQL)**
```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales AS
SELECT date_trunc('month', order_date) AS month, SUM(amount) AS revenue
FROM orders GROUP BY month;
```
üìå **Key Points:**  
‚úî **Stores data** (improves read performance).  
‚úî **Must be refreshed manually/automatically**.  
‚úî **Ideal for expensive aggregations**.

---

## üîÑ **3. Key Differences (Views vs. Materialized Views)**

| Feature | **View** | **Materialized View** |  
|---------|---------|----------------------|  
| **Storage** | ‚ùå Virtual | ‚úÖ Physical |  
| **Performance** | Slower (runs query each time) | Faster (precomputed) |  
| **Data Freshness** | Always up-to-date | Stale until refreshed |  
| **Use Case** | Simplifying queries | Reporting, analytics |  

**Diagram:**
```
View: Query ‚Üí [Live Data] ‚Üí Result  
Materialized View: Query ‚Üí [Precomputed Data] ‚Üí Result  
```

## ‚úÖ **4. Why Use Views? Pros & Cons**

### **When to Use?**
‚úî **Simplify complex queries** (e.g., multi-table joins).  
‚úî **Row/column-level security** (hide sensitive data).  
‚úî **Consistent business logic** (reuse queries).

### **Pros & Cons**
| **Pros** | **Cons** |  
|----------|----------|  
| No storage overhead | Slower for complex queries |  
| Always up-to-date | No performance gain |  

**Industry Example:**
- **E-commerce:** A `customer_order_history` view joining `orders`, `products`, and `users`.

---

## üöÄ **5. Why Use Materialized Views? Pros & Cons**

### **When to Use?**
‚úî **Dashboard/reporting queries** (aggregations).  
‚úî **Data warehousing** (OLAP workloads).  
‚úî **High-read, low-write systems**.

### **Pros & Cons**
| **Pros** | **Cons** |  
|----------|----------|  
| Blazing-fast reads | Storage overhead |  
| Reduces CPU load | Stale data risk |  
| Optimized for analytics | Manual refresh needed |  

**Industry Example:**
- **Netflix:** Uses materialized views for **user watch-time analytics**.

---

## üè¢ **6. Industry Use Cases**

| **Industry** | **Use Case** |  
|-------------|-------------|  
| **Finance** | Daily sales reports (materialized views) |  
| **Healthcare** | Patient records view (row-level security) |  
| **E-commerce** | Product catalog joins (views) |  

---

## üõ† **7. Best Practices**

### **For Views:**
1. **Avoid nested views** (hard to debug).
2. **Use for security** (e.g., `CREATE VIEW masked_users AS SELECT id, name FROM users`).

### **For Materialized Views:**
1. **Schedule refreshes** (e.g., nightly for analytics).
2. **Index materialized views** for faster access.

**PostgreSQL Example (Auto-Refresh):**
```sql
-- Refresh every hour
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_orders REFRESH EVERY 1 HOUR AS
SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY user_id;
```

---

## üåç **8. How Big Companies Use Them**

| **Company** | **Usage** |  
|------------|----------|  
| **Amazon** | Materialized views for real-time inventory dashboards |  
| **Uber** | Views for driver-rider matching logic |  
| **Spotify** | Materialized views for playlist recommendations |  

---

## ‚òï **9. Java Code Examples**

### **Using Views with JPA/Hibernate**
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "users")
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private boolean isActive;
}

// Spring Data JPA View Query
public interface ActiveUserView {
    Long getId();
    String getName();
}

@Query("SELECT u.id as id, u.name as name FROM User u WHERE u.isActive = true")
List<ActiveUserView> findActiveUsers();
```

### **Materialized Views with Spring + PostgreSQL**
```java
// Manually refresh materialized view
@Repository
public class SalesRepository {
    @PersistenceContext
    private EntityManager em;

    public void refreshMonthlySales() {
        em.createNativeQuery("REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales").executeUpdate();
    }
}
```

## ‚ùì **10. Interview Q&A**

### **Q1: What‚Äôs the difference between a view and a materialized view?**
**A:**
- **View:** Virtual, always up-to-date, no storage.
- **Materialized View:** Physical snapshot, faster reads, requires refresh.

### **Q2: When would you use a materialized view over a view?**
**A:** When you need **fast reads** and can tolerate **slightly stale data** (e.g., dashboards).

### **Q3: How do you refresh a materialized view?**
**A:**
- **Manually:** `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW monthly_sales`
- **Automatically:** PostgreSQL `REFRESH EVERY X HOUR`

### **Q4: Can you index a view? What about a materialized view?**
**A:**
- **View:** ‚ùå No (it‚Äôs just a query).
- **Materialized View:** ‚úÖ Yes (treat it like a table).

### **Q5: What are the downsides of materialized views?**
**A:**
- Storage overhead.
- Stale data if not refreshed.
- Write latency (if underlying tables change frequently).

Here are 15 additional interview questions and answers in the same clear, structured format:

---

### **Q6: How do materialized views improve query performance in data warehouses?**
**A:**
- Pre-computes complex joins/aggregations
- Reduces CPU load on source databases
- Enables faster analytics queries (e.g., SUM/AVG operations)
- Example: Snowflake/materialized views for daily sales reports

---

### **Q7: What happens to a view when the underlying table structure changes?**
**A:**
- Views become invalid if referenced columns are modified/dropped
- Requires `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` to update the definition
- Some databases (like Oracle) provide `FORCE` option to create invalid views

---

### **Q8: Can you update data through a view? What about materialized views?**
**A:**
- **Views:** ‚úÖ Yes (with limitations - must reference single table, no aggregates)
- **Materialized Views:** ‚ùå No (except in Oracle with "ON COMMIT" refresh)
- Example: `UPDATE customer_orders_view SET status='shipped' WHERE id=100`

---

### **Q9: How would you implement a materialized view in MySQL?**
**A:**
MySQL doesn't natively support materialized views, so alternatives are:
1. Create summary tables + triggers
2. Use stored procedures for refreshes
3. Leverage tools like FlexViews (open-source implementation)

---

### **Q10: What's incremental materialized view refresh? When is it better than full refresh?**
**A:**
- Only updates changed data (not entire dataset)
- Better when:
    - Underlying data changes are <10% of total
    - Refresh frequency is high
    - View contains large datasets
- Example: Oracle `FAST REFRESH` option

---

### **Q11: How do views help with database security?**
**A:**
- Column-level security (hide sensitive fields)
- Row-level filtering (e.g., `WHERE department='HR'`)
- Permission isolation (grant access to view but not tables)
- Example: `CREATE VIEW hr_employees AS SELECT id,name FROM employees WHERE dept='HR'`

---

### **Q12: What query rewrite optimizations can databases do with materialized views?**
**A:**
- Automatic query redirection to materialized views
- Oracle: `QUERY_REWRITE_ENABLED` parameter
- PostgreSQL: Only manual redirection via view names
- Example: Query for `SUM(sales)` uses pre-aggregated materialized view

---

### **Q13: When would you avoid using materialized views?**
**A:**

- ‚ùå Real-time data requirements
- ‚ùå Frequently updated source tables (high refresh overhead)
- ‚ùå Limited storage resources
- ‚ùå Simple queries with fast execution

---

### **Q14: How do materialized views work in distributed systems like Cassandra?**
**A:**
- Cassandra's "Materialized Views" are actually automatic denormalization
- Maintains consistency via base table updates
- Example: Creating user_email_index as materialized view of users table

---

### **Q15: What's the performance impact of nested views?**
**A:**
- Can lead to "nested loop" execution plans
- Harder for optimizer to analyze
- Best practice: Limit to 2-3 levels max
- Example: `view3` depends on `view2` which depends on `view1`

---

### **Q16: How do you determine when to refresh a materialized view?**
**A:**
1. Time-based: Nightly for reports
2. Event-based: After ETL jobs complete
3. Demand-based: User-triggered refresh
4. Change-data-capture: Oracle MATERIALIZED VIEW LOG

---

### **Q17: What metadata tables store information about views/materialized views?**
**A:**
- PostgreSQL: `pg_views`, `pg_matviews`
- Oracle: `USER_VIEWS`, `USER_MVIEWS`
- SQL Server: `sys.views`, `sys.indexes`
- Example query: `SELECT * FROM pg_matviews WHERE matviewname='monthly_sales'`

---

### **Q18: How do materialized views differ in OLTP vs OLAP systems?**
**A:**

| **OLTP** | **OLAP** |
|----------|----------|
| Rarely used | Core feature |
| Small, transactional | Large, analytical |
| On-demand refresh | Scheduled refresh |

---

### **Q19: Can you partition a materialized view?**
**A:**
‚úÖ Yes, in most enterprise databases:
- Oracle: Partitioned materialized views
- PostgreSQL: Partitioned tables acting as materialized views
- Example: Time-partitioned sales data materialized view

---

### **Q20: What's the difference between a materialized view and a cache?**
**A:**
- **Materialized View:**
    - Disk-persisted
    - SQL-accessible
    - Requires explicit refresh
- **Cache:**
    - Memory-resident
    - Key-value access
    - Automatic invalidation

---

## üéØ **11. Conclusion**
- **Use Views** for simplifying queries and security.
- **Use Materialized Views** for reporting/analytics.
- **Big companies** rely on both for scalability.

üöÄ **Pro Tip:** In interviews, mention trade-offs (e.g., "Materialized views speed up reads but need refreshes").
