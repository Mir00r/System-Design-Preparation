### üéØ STAR Method Example from Past Work

### ‚≠ê **SITUATION**
While building the **Distributed Cache System**, I faced a technical challenge:  
**How to efficiently expire entries by TTL (Time-To-Live) without hurting GET/PUT performance under high concurrency?**

At first, naive solutions (e.g., checking TTL on every GET) slowed everything down badly.

---

### üìã **TASK**
My goal was:
- Make the cache **auto-expire stale entries fast**.
- **Don't slow down** normal reads/writes.
- **Keep it thread-safe** and memory-efficient.

---

### ‚ö° **ACTION**
Here‚Äôs exactly what I did:

‚úÖ **Understand the Problem Deeply:**
- Why is GET slow? Because checking all timestamps synchronously is heavy under load.

‚úÖ **Break the Problem:**
- Split into two concerns:  
  (a) Fast normal operations  
  (b) Background expiry.

‚úÖ **Do Research:**
- Read about how **Redis** and **Guava Cache** manage expiration.
- Redis uses **lazy** and **active** expiration combined.
- Guava uses **Scheduled Executor + Priority Queue (Heap)** for efficient TTL.

‚úÖ **Proactively Suggest Solution:**
- Proposed adding a **background cleaner thread** (like Redis active expiry).
- Suggested using a **PriorityQueue** ordered by expiration time for quick expiry lookup.

‚úÖ **Prototype Quickly:**
- Implemented a small PoC in a separate Java class:
    - Background thread sleeps for a few milliseconds.
    - Pops expired entries from PriorityQueue.
    - Removes them from the main cache.

‚úÖ **Evaluate Tradeoffs:**
- Cleaner thread adds **slight CPU usage**, but **read/write speed stays almost unaffected** ‚Äî big win.

‚úÖ **Implement Final Solution:**
- Added it into the final project.
- Made background cleaning configurable (optional to enable/disable via builder pattern).

---

### üèÜ **RESULT**
- **GET/PUT operations remained fast** even with TTL enabled.
- **Cache size controlled automatically** without manual interventions.
- **System performance improved 30%** under load testing compared to synchronous expiry.

And this whole proactive attitude (suggestion + research + proof) **saved days of trial-and-error** for the project.
