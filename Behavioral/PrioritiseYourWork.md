> "How do you prioritise your work if you have many deliverables due?"

Here's how I would answer that using the **STAR method**, showing my approach to prioritization when multiple deliverables are due:

---

## ✨ STAR Answer

---

### ⭐ **SITUATION**
In my previous role, I was tasked with handling multiple **deliverables** at once, including **feature releases, bug fixes**, and **system upgrades** for a banking platform. On several occasions, I had **overlapping deadlines** — for example, I had to finalize a major **loan approval feature**, conduct **system performance optimization**, and ensure **regulatory compliance updates** before a deadline.

---

### 📋 **TASK**
My main task was to ensure all **deliverables were completed on time** without sacrificing **quality**. However, because of the tight timeline, I needed to **prioritize efficiently** to ensure that the **most critical tasks** were done first.

---

### ⚡ **ACTION**

Here’s the approach I take for prioritizing under pressure:

1. **Identify Business Criticality**
    - **Align with stakeholders** to understand which tasks are **business-critical** (e.g., features that impact user transactions, compliance, or security).
    - **Communicate deadlines** with stakeholders to adjust expectations or resources when necessary.
    - **Focus on high-impact work** — e.g., completing the loan approval feature that drives user adoption, or completing compliance updates to avoid regulatory penalties.

2. **Break Tasks into Actionable Chunks**
    - **Split large tasks** into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks, each with its own mini-deadline.
    - Prioritize them using the **Eisenhower Matrix** (Urgent/Important, Not Urgent/Important, etc.). This helps me **visualize** what needs to be tackled first.

3. **Use the 80/20 Rule (Pareto Principle)**
    - I focus on the **20% of tasks** that will give the **80% of impact**. For example, if a system performance update can improve the entire system’s efficiency, I’ll prioritize that over smaller, lower-impact updates.

4. **Communicate and Re-negotiate Deadlines**
    - **Always over-communicate** if any task is delayed or if priorities change — either push non-critical tasks to the backburner or delegate them where possible.
    - If necessary, I **re-negotiate deadlines** based on feedback from stakeholders, explaining the impact of certain tasks versus others.

5. **Time-blocking & Task Management**
    - I break my day into **time blocks** where I allocate specific hours to specific tasks — ensuring **deep focus** on high-priority items (e.g., no distractions for the loan feature development in the morning).
    - Use tools like **Jira** or **Trello** to track progress and flag urgent items. I **review progress** daily and adjust timelines or resources accordingly.

6. **Delegate and Collaborate**
    - If I have **non-essential tasks** or areas where I can’t add much value directly (e.g., testing), I delegate to junior team members or collaborate with peers to lighten the load.

7. **Buffer Time**
    - I always keep some **buffer time** for unexpected issues (e.g., urgent bug fixes or unforeseen delays), which keeps me flexible and reduces stress.

---

### 🏆 **RESULT**

- **All high-priority tasks were delivered on time** and with high quality, including the loan feature and compliance update.
- By keeping open communication, I managed **stakeholder expectations** effectively, preventing any major pushback.
- **Reduced stress levels** by managing tasks in a structured way, which led to **better team collaboration** and **faster decision-making**.
- Ultimately, this approach helped the team **meet all key deadlines**, and I received positive feedback from both my manager and stakeholders for managing multiple high-priority projects successfully.

# 🎯 Final short version if they want it summarized:

> "When I have multiple deliverables, I prioritize based on business impact, break tasks down into manageable chunks, communicate with stakeholders, and use structured time-blocking and the Eisenhower Matrix. This ensures critical tasks are completed first while minimizing delays and stress."

This method helps me stay **focused and productive** even when deadlines are tight. Would you like more details on **how I deal with shifting priorities** when things change last minute? 😄
