### **1️⃣ A Time When You Built a Product and Failed? Why Did You Fail?**
🎯 **Example Answer:**

*"At CMED Health, I was part of a team developing a **modularized prescription and order management service**. The goal was to enhance workflow efficiency, but the initial version faced **performance bottlenecks** due to suboptimal database design. We underestimated the load and didn’t optimize query execution upfront, which led to **slow response times and scalability issues** when adoption grew."*

💡 **What I learned:**  
*"I learned that **early performance testing and database indexing** are crucial, especially for high-transaction healthcare applications. In my next project at Silverlake Axis, I applied these lessons, implementing indexing and partitioning, which improved query execution by **5% and enhanced data streaming efficiency**."*

🚀 **Why This Works:**  
✔ Shows a real challenge and failure.  
✔ Demonstrates **technical problem-solving** and improvement.  
✔ Highlights how you **applied the learning** in a later role.

### **2️⃣ Tell Me About a Failure You Had**
🎯 **Example Answer:**

*"During my time at CMED Health, I led a transition from a **monolithic system to a multi-modular monolithic structure**. While technically sound, I initially overlooked the importance of **change management and stakeholder alignment**. This led to delays because end-users were unfamiliar with the new structure and required **additional training**."*

💡 **What I learned:**  
*"I learned that technical excellence isn’t enough—**aligning with users, providing training, and getting early buy-in** are just as important. In my current role, I ensure that **any major architectural change includes early user feedback and training**, avoiding adoption resistance."*

🚀 **Why This Works:**  
✔ Highlights both **technical** and **soft skills**.  
✔ Shows self-awareness and the ability to **improve processes**.

---

### **3️⃣ Some Recent Negative Feedback You Received**
🎯 **Example Answer:**

*"A few months ago, I received feedback that my **technical documentation could be clearer** for non-technical stakeholders. While my documentation was comprehensive, it was too **developer-focused** and lacked enough **business-context explanations**."*

💡 **What I did differently:**  
*"I took this feedback seriously and started using **simpler language, diagrams, and concise summaries** when writing API or architectural documentation. As a result, business teams found it easier to understand, leading to **better collaboration and faster decision-making**."*

🚀 **Why This Works:**  
✔ Shows **openness to feedback** (not defensive).  
✔ Demonstrates **proactive improvement**.

---

### **4️⃣ Something That You Would’ve Done Differently**
🎯 **Example Answer:**

*"When building the Gateway Microservice at Silverlake Axis, I focused heavily on **third-party API integrations** for security and fraud detection. While successful, I realized later that I could have **designed it in a more modular way** to make future API integrations easier. Instead of tightly coupling authentication with the core logic, I would’ve used a **plugin-based approach** for more flexibility."*

💡 **What I learned:**  
*"Since then, I’ve incorporated **modular design patterns** into my work, ensuring better maintainability and easier expansion in future projects."*

🚀 **Why This Works:**  
✔ Highlights **self-improvement**.  
✔ Shows **technical depth** and **architectural thinking**.
