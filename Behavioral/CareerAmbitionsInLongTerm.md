> "What are your career ambitions, i.e. do you plan to stay with Maybank long term? Do you plan to progress your career here?"

Here's how I would answer this question in a professional, **STAR-style** way, keeping it genuine and positive toward Company X:

## ✨ STAR Answer

---

### ⭐ **SITUATION**
As a technology professional with strong experience in **banking and financial applications**, I always aim to work where **innovation, stability, and growth opportunities** align.  
When I applied to **Company X**, it was not a random choice — it was very deliberate because of Company X’s strong focus on **digital transformation**, **customer-first initiatives**, and **regional leadership** in ASEAN.

---

### 📋 **TASK**
My career goal is not just to **build applications** — it is to **contribute meaningfully to impactful financial services**, and **grow into a technical leader** who can **mentor others, drive innovation**, and **deliver strategic value** to the bank.

At Company X, my tasks for my own career are:
- **Keep improving my technical depth** (coding, architecture, security, cloud).
- **Build leadership and stakeholder management skills**.
- **Grow into technical lead/solution architect roles** over time.
- **Contribute ideas** that align with Company X’s digital ambitions (M25+ strategy, etc).

### ⚡ **ACTION**

How I plan to achieve this ambition inside Company X:

✅ **Deliver consistently excellent work** — quality, reliability, clean coding, documentation.  
✅ **Proactively suggest improvements** (e.g., security, scalability, user experience).  
✅ **Take ownership** of not just coding tasks, but full feature outcomes (impact on users).  
✅ **Keep learning and upskilling** — especially cloud (AWS/Azure), security (MAS TRM compliance), performance optimization.  
✅ **Mentor others** once I am more senior — share knowledge, review code, help junior engineers.  
✅ **Align closely with Company X’s digital roadmap** — ensuring my work directly supports bigger goals like digital onboarding, cashless payments, AI-driven banking.

### 🏆 **RESULT**

By following this approach:

- I **stay committed to Company X** for the long term if growth opportunities are available.
- I **progress my career within Company X** — from developer → senior developer → lead → architect if possible.
