Got it â€” you want a **deep dive just into the logical thinking** behind my coding for that project.  
Letâ€™s break it down clearly, step-by-step, focused only on **how I thought through the code** (not retelling the story again).

---

## ðŸ§  Logical Thinking Behind the Coding

---

### 1. **Start from the User Perspective (API-first Thinking)**
**Question I asked myself:**  
*"If someone uses this cache, what basic actions do they need?"*

- `get(key)`
- `put(key, value)`
- `delete(key)`

ðŸ‘‰ So, I first **defined interfaces** (`Cache<K, V>`) to clearly set the **contract** of what functionality is expected, without worrying about the implementation details yet.

---

### 2. **Focus on Core Requirements (Prioritization Thinking)**
**Next question:**  
*"What are the most critical features users will expect beyond CRUD?"*

- **High-speed access** (fast GET/PUT)
- **Thread safety** (multiple threads reading/writing)
- **TTL support** (auto-expire old data)
- **Eviction policy (LRU)** when full

ðŸ‘‰ I prioritized writing the **core storage class** (`ConcurrentHashMap`) first, before tackling secondary concerns like TTL and eviction.

---

### 3. **Decompose Complexity (Divide and Conquer Thinking)**
**Big question:**  
*"How can I split the system so that each part is simple?"*

ðŸ‘‰ I separated responsibilities:
- **Storage module** â†’ Store key-value pairs.
- **Eviction module** â†’ Manage when and which keys to remove.
- **TTL manager module** â†’ Handle expiration based on time.

Each module had its own class.  
This **reduced code complexity** and made testing easier.

---

### 4. **Balance Performance vs. Simplicity (Optimization Thinking)**
**Problem:**
- Simple implementations (e.g., locking the whole map) are easy but **hurt performance**.
- Too complicated solutions (e.g., fine-grained locking) might introduce **bugs**.

ðŸ‘‰ So, I picked a **middle ground**:
- Use `ConcurrentHashMap` for basic operations.
- Add **segment-based locking** for eviction control only.
- Only **lock the necessary parts** â€” not the entire structure.

---

### 5. **Use Known Patterns (Pattern Recognition Thinking)**
Instead of inventing new solutions, I **borrowed battle-tested ideas**:

- **Builder Pattern** â†’ for building cache instances with optional settings (like max size, TTL defaults).
- **Strategy Pattern** â†’ for supporting pluggable eviction policies (LRU now, others later).
- **Singleton Pattern** â†’ for cache manager, so thereâ€™s only one instance per node.

ðŸ‘‰ This made the code **future-proof** and **extendable** without massive rewrites.

---

### 6. **Fail Fast and Clean (Defensive Thinking)**
I thought:  
*"If something goes wrong, itâ€™s better to fail early than to corrupt data."*

ðŸ‘‰ So I added:
- Null checks at the API layer.
- Exceptions if invalid parameters (like negative TTL) were passed.
- Safe defaults (e.g., if no eviction strategy is given, use LRU).

---

### 7. **Think About Future Scaling (Forward-Looking Thinking)**
Even though itâ€™s a small project, I asked:  
*"What if tomorrow, the system needs to add nodes dynamically?"*

ðŸ‘‰ So:
- I designed storage around **consistent hashing**.
- I simulated multi-node clusters even though it ran on a single JVM.

This made it easy to teach **horizontal scaling concepts** later on.

Awesome! ðŸŽ¯  
Hereâ€™s a **small but realistic code snippet** showing how I applied that **logical thinking** in a real piece of the project â€”  
I'll show you:

- `Cache` interface (API-first design)
- `LRUCache` implementation (using ConcurrentHashMap + Doubly Linked List)
- Builder pattern for clean object creation

---

## ðŸ“œ Code Example

### 1. **Cache Interface** (API-first Thinking)

```java
public interface Cache<K, V> {
    V get(K key);
    void put(K key, V value);
    void delete(K key);
}
```

ðŸ§  *Thinking*:  
Define a clean **contract** first.  
Whoever implements this, users can interact without worrying about *how* it works underneath (abstraction).

---

### 2. **LRUCache Implementation** (Thread-safe + O(1) access)

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap;
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

public class LRUCache<K, V> implements Cache<K, V> {
    private final int capacity;
    private final ConcurrentHashMap<K, Node<K, V>> map;
    private final DoublyLinkedList<K, V> dll;
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
        this.dll = new DoublyLinkedList<>();
    }

    @Override
    public V get(K key) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            Node<K, V> node = map.get(key);
            if (node == null) {
                return null;
            }
            dll.moveToFront(node);
            return node.value;
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void put(K key, V value) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            if (map.containsKey(key)) {
                Node<K, V> node = map.get(key);
                node.value = value;
                dll.moveToFront(node);
            } else {
                if (map.size() >= capacity) {
                    Node<K, V> lru = dll.removeTail();
                    if (lru != null) {
                        map.remove(lru.key);
                    }
                }
                Node<K, V> newNode = new Node<>(key, value);
                dll.addToFront(newNode);
                map.put(key, newNode);
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void delete(K key) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            Node<K, V> node = map.remove(key);
            if (node != null) {
                dll.removeNode(node);
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. **Supporting DoublyLinkedList + Node Classes**

```java
class Node<K, V> {
    K key;
    V value;
    Node<K, V> prev, next;

    Node(K key, V value) {
        this.key = key;
        this.value = value;
    }
}

class DoublyLinkedList<K, V> {
    private Node<K, V> head, tail;

    void addToFront(Node<K, V> node) {
        node.next = head;
        node.prev = null;
        if (head != null) head.prev = node;
        head = node;
        if (tail == null) tail = node;
    }

    void moveToFront(Node<K, V> node) {
        removeNode(node);
        addToFront(node);
    }

    Node<K, V> removeTail() {
        if (tail == null) return null;
        Node<K, V> temp = tail;
        removeNode(temp);
        return temp;
    }

    void removeNode(Node<K, V> node) {
        if (node.prev != null) node.prev.next = node.next;
        else head = node.next;
        
        if (node.next != null) node.next.prev = node.prev;
        else tail = node.prev;
    }
}
```

---

### 4. **Builder Pattern for Flexible Creation**

```java
public class LRUCacheBuilder<K, V> {
    private int capacity = 100; // Default

    public LRUCacheBuilder<K, V> withCapacity(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        return this;
    }

    public LRUCache<K, V> build() {
        return new LRUCache<>(capacity);
    }
}
```

**Usage:**
```java
Cache<String, String> cache = new LRUCacheBuilder<String, String>()
                                  .withCapacity(50)
                                  .build();
```
