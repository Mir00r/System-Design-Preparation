> "If one of the business stakeholders makes a last minute change just as the project is about to be completed, how will you react and respond?"

Great — another super practical scenario! 🎯  
Let’s again go through it properly, using **STAR methodology** (Situation → Task → Action → Result) + show my real logical working style.

---

## ✨ STAR Answer

---

### ⭐ **SITUATION**
We were about to **complete and deploy** a new **loan application feature** for a banking app.  
Just before final UAT (User Acceptance Testing) signoff, a business stakeholder suddenly requested:
> "Can we add an extra step where users must **upload an income proof document** before submitting the loan form?"

This was **not part of the original scope** and **impacted frontend, backend, validation, and workflow logic**.

---

### 📋 **TASK**
My responsibilities at that moment were:
- Stay professional and **handle the sudden change without emotional reactions**.
- Quickly **assess the impact** on project timeline, code, testing, and deployment.
- **Communicate transparently** with the stakeholder and the team.
- Find a **balanced way** to either accommodate or suggest alternatives if needed.

---

### ⚡ **ACTION**

Here's exactly how I handled it:

✅ **Stay Calm and Positive:**
- First, acknowledged their request politely:
  > "Thank you for sharing this additional requirement! Let me quickly assess its impact so we can plan properly."

✅ **Do Quick Impact Analysis:**
- Within a couple of hours:
    - Identified frontend changes needed (new upload component + form validation).
    - Backend changes (new API endpoint for document upload + S3 storage logic).
    - Workflow changes (block form submission until upload is completed).
    - Additional testing required (unit + integration + security tests).

✅ **Present Options and Trade-offs:**
- Scheduled a quick meeting and presented options:

| Option | Details | Impact |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 1. Quick Patch | Allow uploading document later, post-submission via separate link. | Minimal code change. Release now. Upload feature via small update. |
| 2. Full Change Now | Block form submission until document uploaded. | 1-2 week delay in production. Retest everything.|

✅ **Suggest Best Option Based on Context:**
- Recommended Option 1 (Quick Patch first) to avoid delaying the critical Go-Live.
- Explained professionally:
  > "This allows us to deliver on time, avoid major risk, and still meet your compliance need in a few days."

✅ **Get Consensus:**
- Business agreed after understanding trade-offs clearly.

✅ **Document Change Request:**
- Created a formal **Change Request (CR)** in JIRA/Confluence, including timelines and risks.
- Made sure the new upload feature was prioritized in the next sprint.

✅ **Keep Team Motivated:**
- Quickly aligned the team:
  > "Change requests are part of real-world projects. Let’s treat it as an opportunity to make the product even better."

---

### 🏆 **RESULT**

- We successfully **deployed the main feature on time** ✅.
- **Delivered the new income proof upload** in a safe, incremental update 10 days later ✅.
- **Business stakeholders were happy** because we showed agility and professionalism ✅.
- **Team morale stayed high** because we avoided last-minute panic ✅.

## 🎯 In short, **my natural reaction to last-minute stakeholder changes**:

| Step | What I Do |
|:---|:---|
| 1 | **Acknowledge positively**, stay calm and professional. |
| 2 | **Assess real impact** quickly (cost, timeline, quality). |
| 3 | **Offer clear options** with trade-offs. |
| 4 | **Help business make informed decisions**. |
| 5 | **Document everything** for traceability. |
| 6 | **Motivate the team** — changes are part of growth. |

---

## 🧠 Bonus Tip
✅ Never immediately say "No" even if it’s painful.  
✅ Always respond with **options, risks, and solutions** — it shows maturity and leadership.  
✅ Remember: **Managing stakeholders well is as important as coding** in real-world projects.
