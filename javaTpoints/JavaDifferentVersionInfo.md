## Mastering Java Versions for Interview Preparation: From Java 7 to Java 21 🚀

When preparing for a Java interview, especially at top tech companies, understanding the evolution of the Java language is crucial. Each version of Java brought in significant improvements and features that reflect modern software development needs. In this guide, we’ll dive into the core enhancements of Java 7, 8, 11, 17, and 21, complete with examples, best practices, and how these features are used in the industry today.

### 🔷 Java 7: Project Coin & NIO.2
**Release Date:** July 2011

#### ✨ Key Features:
- **Diamond Operator (`<>`)**: Reduces boilerplate in generic instantiation.
- **Try-with-Resources**: Simplifies resource management.
- **String in switch**: Enables use of strings in `switch` statements.
- **Multi-catch**: Handle multiple exceptions in a single block.
- **NIO.2**: New file I/O APIs with better file handling and asynchronous capabilities.

#### 🏭 Industry Usage:
- Legacy systems.
- Banking and insurance still maintain applications built on Java 7.

#### 🧠 Best Practices:
- Always use try-with-resources when dealing with IO streams.
- Use the diamond operator for cleaner code.

#### 📌 Example:
```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

### 🔷 Java 8: Functional Programming & Streams Revolution
**Release Date:** March 2014

#### ✨ Key Features:
- **Lambda Expressions**
- **Streams API**
- **Functional Interfaces**
- **Default and Static Methods in Interfaces**
- **Optional Class**
- **Date and Time API (java.time)**

#### 🏭 Industry Usage:
- Widely adopted across all major companies like Netflix, Google, Amazon.
- Base for functional programming in Java.

#### 🧠 Best Practices:
- Use streams for data transformation and filtering.
- Use Optional to avoid nulls.

#### 📌 Example:
```java
List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
names.stream()
     .filter(name -> name.startsWith("A"))
     .forEach(System.out::println);
```

#### 📊 Visualization:
```text
Input List --> Stream --> Filter ("A") --> forEach (print)
```

### 🔷 Java 11: Long-Term Support (LTS) Version
**Release Date:** September 2018

#### ✨ Key Features:
- **`var` for local variables**
- **HTTP Client API**
- **String methods (`lines()`, `strip()`, `isBlank()` etc.)**
- **Flight Recorder & Mission Control**

#### 🏭 Industry Usage:
- Used in production by large-scale enterprise systems.
- Often selected for microservices due to LTS.

#### 🧠 Best Practices:
- Use `var` for readability but avoid overuse.
- Replace Apache HttpClient with the built-in HTTP Client API.

#### 📌 Example:
```java
var list = List.of("Java", "11", "Features");
list.forEach(System.out::println);
```

### 🔷 Java 17: Another LTS with Powerful Additions
**Release Date:** September 2021

#### ✨ Key Features:
- **Sealed Classes**
- **Pattern Matching for instanceof**
- **Enhanced switch (Preview)**
- **JEP 356: Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators**

#### 🏭 Industry Usage:
- Preferred for new projects requiring LTS.
- Used in cloud-native and Spring Boot 3.x applications.

#### 🧠 Best Practices:
- Use sealed classes to control type hierarchies.
- Simplify `instanceof` checks with pattern matching.

#### 📌 Example:
```java
if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase());
}
```

### 🔷 Java 21: The Cutting Edge 🌟
**Release Date:** September 2023

#### ✨ Key Features:
- **Record Patterns and Pattern Matching for switch**
- **Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**
- **Structured Concurrency**
- **String Templates (Preview)**
- **Sequenced Collections**

#### 🏭 Industry Usage:
- Experimental and early adoption in high-performance systems.
- Virtual threads being tested in web servers and reactive systems.

#### 🧠 Best Practices:
- Use virtual threads to scale IO-bound tasks.
- Use record patterns for concise data modeling.

#### 📌 Example:
```java
Thread.startVirtualThread(() -> System.out.println("Hello from a virtual thread!"));
```
